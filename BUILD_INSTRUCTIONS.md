- You'll get a link to download your APK when it's done
- You can also view the build progress at [expo.dev](https://expo.dev)

### Step 5: Install on Your Device

1. Download the APK from the link provided
2. Transfer it to your Android device
3. Enable "Install from Unknown Sources" in your device settings
4. Tap the APK file to install
5. Open your app and enjoy! üéâ

## üì± Build Profiles Explained

Your app has three build profiles configured in `eas.json`:

### 1. **Development** (for testing with debugging)
```bash
eas build -p android --profile development
```
- Creates a development build with debugging tools
- Larger file size
- Best for active development

### 2. **Preview** (for testing without debugging)
```bash
eas build -p android --profile preview
```
- Creates an APK file
- Smaller than development build
- **Perfect for sharing with testers**
- Can be installed directly on devices

### 3. **Production** (for Google Play Store)
```bash
eas build -p android --profile production
```
- Creates an AAB (Android App Bundle) file
