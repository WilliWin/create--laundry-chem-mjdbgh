You want to create two React Native apps using Expo 54: one for managing laundry chemicals and another for managing linen stock. Both apps should allow recording new items, editing existing ones, tracking usage/status, and generating PDF reports. You also want a user-friendly and modern UI.\n\nHere's a plan to get started:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   **Chemicals App:**\n    *   A screen to add new chemicals with details like name, initial stock, and usage rate.\n    *   A screen to record chemical usage with date.\n    *   Automatic stock calculation and low stock notifications.\n*   **Linen App:**\n    *   A screen to record new linen items (towels, bedsheets) with initial stock.\n    *   Screens to track linen status (new, dirty, discarded).\n    *   Stock balance calculation.\n*   **Shared Features:**\n    *   User-friendly navigation between screens.\n    *   PDF report generation for both apps.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#f9f9f9` (Light gray for a clean look)\n    *   Text: `#212121` (Dark gray for readability)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#757575` (Medium gray for less important text)\n    *   Primary: `#2962ff` (Blue for main actions)\n    *   Secondary: `#64b5f6` (Light blue for accents)\n    *   Accent: `#ff4081` (Pink for highlights and notifications)\n    *   Card: `#ffffff` (White for cards and containers)\n    *   Highlight: `#ffee58` (Yellow for important information)\n*   **Typography:**\n    *   Use a modern, clean font like \"System\" (default for the platform) or \"Roboto\" for Android and \"San Francisco\" for iOS.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Project Setup:** No changes needed here, assuming the project is already set up with Expo.\n2.  **UI Structure:** Create the basic UI structure for both apps, including screens for adding, editing, and viewing items. This will involve creating new components in the `app/` directory.\n3.  **Data Management:** Implement data management for storing and updating chemical and linen information. Since Supabase is available, we could use it for persistence, but let's start with local state management using React's `useState` hook to keep things simple initially.\n4.  **Functionality:** Implement the core functionality for tracking usage, calculating stock, and generating notifications.\n5.  **PDF Generation:** Integrate a library for generating PDF reports.\n6.  **UI Enhancements:** Add styling and polish the UI to match the design specifications.\n7.  **Navigation:** Ensure seamless navigation between screens using Expo Router.\n\nNow, let's start by creating the basic UI structure and data management for the Chemicals app.\n\nI will now instruct the coding agent to implement the plan and modify the app/(tabs) folder to implement the changes and make the changes visible for the user.\n\nAlso, the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx should be removed.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-29T19:49:46.248447"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create a laundry chemical and linen stock management app!
